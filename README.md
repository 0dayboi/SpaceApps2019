Project Name: SpaceMan

Repo description:
In this repo, we uploaded everything that we were able to create during the hackathon weekends.(18-19-20 October)
Some code's may seem uncompleted due to the low amount of time. However everything about the project can be found here
   
    The Image Classification folder will show you the whole dataset that we used to train Google's AutoML Vision API, to later use in our     project, and the .csv file was created to show how each image was used in the training proccess.
    
    The src folder will have every single code that we wrote, and took from the internet during the weekend. The SpaceMan Commander folder consists of the Visual Studio C# solution, that is the admin panel of the robot which analyzes the data tooken from the robot and aswell uses the images tooked from the robot, uploads it to Google's Vision API to further analyze the rock sample. Meanwhile the arduino side folder consists the code's of the two arduino's onboard the robot. One is the image processing arduino, which captures image from the OV7670 camera, and the other, is where the communcation is linked between the commander via bluetooth, and where the most of the analysis happen
    
    The References text fill have the links that we researched during the hackathon.
